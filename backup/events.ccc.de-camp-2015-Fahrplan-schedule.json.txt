In recent times, thanks to scientific advancements, reduced manufacturing costs, and increased sophistication in technology and materials, space science has become more commercially and publicly accessible now than in any other time in history - and many private individuals are taking the exploration of space into their own hands, often in direct partnership with formerly unapproachable government agencies.\r\n\r\nA new wave of administrators and executives in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have made great strides in releasing software and hardware technologies used in their space program, as well as the data and imagery produced by their missions, into the worldwide public domain.

","description":"After the Snowden revelations, demand for encrypted end-to-end communication has skyrocketed, even amongst ordinary users. As also shown by the catastrophic fate of Lavabit, running a high-security communications provider is fraught with danger, both political and technical. Yet today we see services that essentially sell security \"snake oil\" taking off with users, while real end-to-end encryption is barely used by activists, much less ordinary people. We still have do not have widespread deployment of OpenPGP, and post-email messaging protocols such as OpenWhisper still have less than a million users. Fundamental standards such as OpenPGP existing for over thirty years, but software such as Enigmail is still claimed to be virtually unusable. What is the source of this massive failure, and how can it be fixed? \r\n\r\n How can we combat the fundamental problems afflicting encrypted messaging, from e-mail to beyond, so that it becomes a fundamental right for all people to have end-to-end encrypted messaging? This roundtable will bring together software projects working in this space to reflect on their future, debate their differences, and possibly develop a common strategy for the future. Questions to be addressed are:\r\n\r\n1.  Are standards the solution or the problem? The IETF has recently re-opened the OpenPGP mailing list, and there is discussion around the Darkmail (DIME) protocols brewing. However, even the OpenPGP Working Group is not tackling the hard problems of metadata protection. Another strategy is to ditch e-mail entirely and go with new protocols such as TextSecure, but these protocols are still not federated and are thus centralized with particular applications. Decentralized blockchain-based messaging alternatives have also not taken off.\r\n\r\n2. Why is the software still unusable by ordinary users? Two years onwards, we still do not have a better interface than Thunderbird, which has been abandoned by Mozilla. Mailpile is still in beta. Pixelated is still under development. Furthermore, how do we communicate to users if their messages are secure or not?\r\n\r\n3. What research problems remain open? Currently, e-mail leaks metadata through the header, as well as through timing information and network traffic. Keyservers remain broken in terms of authentication and also reveal the social graph while key revocation and signing is difficult. Academic work on mix networking and privacy-enhancing technologies desperately needs to \r\n\r\n4. How can we reach critical mass? Some companies such as OpenWhisper are now working with major providers such as WhatsApp. Others such as LEAP are working so that anyone can run their own provider. Start-ups such as Peer.io and Protonmail are pursuing centralized strategies, and even Gmail and Yahoo! are working on end-to-end encryption. Governments such as Brazil and Germany are pushing for nationalized or public-private partnerships for encrypted email, while business models in the 'privacy market' are still unclear at best and seem to be unable to take into account distributed systems. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this even is to bring together key voices in this space so we combat the fundamental problems afflicting encrypted messaging, from e-mail to beyond, so that it becomes a fundamental right for all people to have end-to-end encrypted messaging.\r\n\r\n\r\n","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":3615,"full_public_name":"harryhalpin"},{"id":5619,"full_public_name":"meskio"}],"links":[{"url":"http://leap.se","title":"LEAP"}]},{"id":6734,"guid":"535ed08a-9699-47eb-b2b2-aff3992fcf18","logo":null,"date":"2015-08-14T17:45:00+02:00","start":"17:45","duration":"00:30","room":"A","slug":"camp2015-6734-security_and_usability_in_open_source","title":"Security and Usability in Open Source","subtitle":"What to do, what not to do","track":"Other","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"Tools for encryption and circumventing censorship have developed a reputation for being confusing and difficult to use.

Couple that with spawning of antibiotic resistant bacteria caused by modern farming practices, along with the suffering of the animals themselves, and it's a full blown disaster.  At the same time, cheese is often cited by people as the reason they could never go vegan.  Vegan cheese substitutes have been increasing in quality, but still are not satisfying for many people.\r\n  In the modern age of genetic engineering, however, animals should not be needed to produce cheese.  It is a single protein complex, casein, which is responsible for most of cheese's properties such as melting and stretching.  The genes responsible for producing casein are sequenced for many animals, and so it should be possible to engineer other organisms, such as yeast, to make casein as well.  This is the goal of the Real Vegan Cheese project.\r\n  This project started in the spring of 2014 as a collaboration between Biocurious in Sunnyvale, CA and Counter Culture Labs in Oakland, CA.  Beyond the goal of producing a real cheese in a vegan process, we also formed to enter the international genetically engineered machines competition and show that community labs could compete with academic labs (tl;dr we won), and to provide alternative educational pathways for people interested in learning genetic engineering.

After a month, I contributed some code that caused alerts. I felt bad and it was reverted quickly, never making it to the site. Still, I was surprised about how my colleagues reacted. They did not blame me! I felt support. These people have got my back. I experienced that it is okay to make mistakes and people trust me to fix them.

Just two weeks ago, somebody within the company received the annual prize, our three-armed-sweater, for the most spectacular way to bring down the site. We joked that if somebody does not break the site to get the prize, they are not daring enough in their coding. I am still nervous when pushing new code to the site, but it feels like an exciting anticipation and respect for my work.\r\n\r\nPeople working with complex systems know they are brittle, because they are complex.

Even though it might be just software, this can be a challenging environment.\r\n\r\nProgramming culture is rife with stereotypes of lone-wolf coders. On hacker news, people like to \"well-actually\" each other. I did it, and maybe you do it too. Quite often, we face our coding questions all alone.

Programming in pairs and code reviews are techniques to improve these decisions by adding an extra set of eyes and opinions.

The intention is not to present any new results, but instead the emphasis is on gaining a foundation in the theory of such attacks, so that you will be able to apply them more effectively in more challenging scenarios. As we shall see, such attacks are an extension of other types of side-channel attack (timing and power analysis attacks in particular), with the added promise of bridging air gaps.","description":"We open by introducing the subject of side-channel attacks with a short review of them in general, and focus on key examples of acoustic cryptanalysis in the literature, including analysis of keyboard emanations, a brief look at an historical account of an attack on the Hagelin cipher machine that played a critical role in the Suez Crisis of the 1950's and the more recent results of Genkin, Shamir and Tromer, which forms the primary basis and inspiration of the techniques we will discuss.\r\nWe start the technical section of our talk by giving a background to power supplies for microcomputer systems, initially reviewing linear power supplies, so we have a basis on which we can compare them to the operating principles of switch-mode power supplies that form the key element of acoustic attacks. Along the way, we look at the important design principle of feedback and the relation this has to frequency response, which in turn gives us an estimate of the bandwidth of emanated signal available to us. Then, we explore the mechanisms by which key components of switch-mode power supplies can be caused to generate unwanted acoustics, show just how readily they will do so and how rich the spectral content of such signals can be.\r\nOur next task will be to look at signal acquisition techniques, where we scratch build an ultrasonic USB microphone with 125kHz of bandwidth, for a price at least two orders of magnitude cheaper than commercially available alternatives, yet still sensitive enough to capture the signals of interest. Specifically, we survey options for transducers, the design of the analog signal path and take a look at high data throughput techniques based on DMA to ensure that we can maintain the data rates required. We then discuss difficulties encountered in getting our signal from our data acquisition board into our data analysis system.\r\nSince a considerable amount of the literature on side-channel attacks, particularly simple and differential power analysis attacks, deals with attacks on block ciphers such the Advanced Encryption Standard, rather than public key cryptosystems such as RSA (as dealt with in the Genkin, Shamir and Tromer paper), the focus of our attack will be AES. We will quickly review the processing steps involved in AES and then develop a naive implementation of AES-128, paying particular attention to the construction of the S-boxes, since the data-dependent lookup times are the source of timing variations. Our attack is essentially an adaptation of the classic cache timing attack described by Daniel J. Bernstein, where the leaked timing information is obtained instead via the acoustic channel. Our target machine will be a netbook with an Intel Atom N270 (24kB L1 cache, 512KB L2 cache) together with a cheap and particularly noisy AC power supply (model PA-1700-02). We will discuss passive techniques to improve sound amplification in our test setup which will be familar to anyone who has played a stringed musical instrument.\r\nFinally, we move into the data processing and attack implementation section of the talk. In order to determine the run-time of our AES implementation for a given key, we will first need to be able to distinguish the difference in acoustic emanation of the system under load, compared to the idle-load condition. To do this, we will use the discrete-time Fourier transform of the acoustic signal, focusing on a suitable band of frequencies, where changes in amplitude correlate with CPU load changes. This will involve a discussion of the choice of FFT frame size against spectral resolution, choice of suitable windowing function and filtering techniques, to enable us to distinguish more accurately the transition from idle-load to load states.\r\nThe attack itself is conducted along the same lines as Bernstein's, with the victim machine running the AES process as a server to which we send UDP packets from our analysis machine, with plaintexts that are then encrypted by the server using its private key. The attack proceeds in two phases. The first involves using known keys and measuring the aggregate encryption time of each, thereby gathering statistics about key-dependent biases in the runtimes. In the second phase, the server chooses a random key which we are not told and we use the previously gathered statistics, together with data from a large sample of suitably chosen plaintexts, that we send to determine bit-by-bit the unknown private key. We spend some time considering options for statistical analyses that might lead to a possible reduction in the number of samples necessary to extract the complete key.\r\nConcluding the talk we discuss standard techniques to mitigate side-channel attacks found in the literature, as well as possible further extensions of the attack presented. It is hoped this will set the scene for the discussion section of the talk, where these ideas can be explored further.","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":5489,"full_public_name":"Dan Hagon"}],"links":[]}]}},{"index":2,"date":"2015-08-15","day_start":"2015-08-15T10:30:00+02:00","day_end":"2015-08-16T02:00:00+02:00","rooms":{"A":[{"id":6842,"guid":"6587bc79-27e5-4cf3-847b-77b0acc96682","logo":"/system/logos/6842/medium/hackerspaces_logo.jpg?1435872589","date":"2015-08-15T10:30:00+02:00","start":"10:30","duration":"00:30","room":"A","slug":"camp2015-6842-hackerspace_design_patterns_2_0","title":"Hackerspace Design Patterns 2.0","subtitle":"","track":"Ethics, Society & Politics","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"The presentation of the Hackerspace Design Patterns at CCCamp 2007 / 24C3 started the international hackerspace movement!

A small sampling of what you can expect to hear about is listed below.\r\n\r\nMy own PhD research was focused on the cosmic microwave background (remnant radiation from the big bang), which is best viewed with mm-wavelength detectors. This wavelength range is notoriously difficult to work in, and we have to operate our superconducting detectors a mere .25 degrees above absolute zero.\r\n\r\nOther experiments aim to measure neutrinos, which are particles that almost never interact with anything. But how do you measure something that only interacts rarely with your detector? One experiment's solution is to use a several cubic kilometer slab of the Antarctic ice cap as a the detector--the \"just make it bigger\" approach.\r\n\r\nIn practice, there are always problems that crop up when working at the edges of human understanding and the laws of physics, some fundamental, and some mundane but hilarious.
