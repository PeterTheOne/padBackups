Why should people use and or practice open source softwares? What is in it for you?

The knitting machine that I am using, normally has a computer  from the 80s. Some have these scanners that are really old, and usually  do not   work anymore. They became obsolete. If it wasn’t for the open source  people who work for free, we couldn’t have make use of these technologies anymore. They decided that they should do something about these machines, found that it was not that complicated to connect  these knitting machines directly to computers. I think it is a really good example how open source is important, because these machines are  no   longer produced and industry is no longer interested in producing  them   again, and they would have died without further use.

It is also  important the idea of open source is about sharing. If you  try  to do  everything from zero, you just never advance. Now with open   source,  somebody  does something that you have access to what he  does,  and you  can take it further and take it to different direction.

I haven't  always used open source software. It came about through teaching at the Piet Zwart where that was the sort of decision made in large part  because of Femke Snelting who designed the program and brought a bunch of people together where that was the question about how do our tools  influence the practice, how they are used. And so, part of my process is  then teaching in that program was to use free software more and more.  In fact, I should say, I had already been using one particular piece of  free software which is FFmpeg which is a program that lets you  work with video. So there again there was that kind of connection, that was just by the virtue of the fact that was one of the only tools available really could take a video, pull out  frames, work with lots of  different formats, just this kind of  amazing  tool. So it started with  kind of convenience. But then more that I learned about the whole kind  of approach of Open Source, more Open Sources I started to use, like first switch from Mac to maybe Dual  Booting and now indeed I am pretty much only using open source. Not exclusively open source, because I occasionally use platforms online that are not free, and some applications.

What it definitely  seem to be   teaching (??), and this to the question why would I recommend  it to   other people, I am absolutely convinced that you use these tools,  you   are learning much more about inner workings of things, about the   design  decisions that go into a piece of software so that you are   actually  understanding at a very deep level, and the level then lets  you  move  between different tools. Or else tools change, or new kinds  of  things  are offered, I think it is really a deep learning that helps  you  for  the future. Whereas if you just focus on the specific   particularities  of one platform or piece of software, that is a bit   fragile and will  inevitably change when a software stops being  developed  or some kind of  new kind of way of working comes about. I  think it is  kind of way to  engage really deeply with the subject.

I use open source software every day, as I have Debian on my laptop. I came to it through anarchism - I don't have a tech background - so it's a  political thing mainly. Not that FLOSS represents a utopian model  of   production my any means! (But you can ask Aymeric Mansoux about  that).   As an artist it fits in with my interest in collaborative  production.  I  think the tools we use should be malleable by the people  who use  them.  Unfortunately, IT education needs to improve quite a  lot before  that  ideal becomes reality in most cases.

Politically, I believe in building a culture which is democratic and malleable by    its inhabitants, and FLOSS makes this possible in the realm of   software.  The benefits as a user are not so great unless you are   tech-savvy  enough to really make use of that freedom. The software  does  tend to be  more secure and so on, though I think we're on shaky  ground  if we try to  defend FLOSS in terms of its benefits to the end  user.   Using FLOSS has  a learning curve, and challenges which I put up  with  because I believe  in it socially. This would probably be a  different  answer from someone  who was, say, a sysadmin who could seee  really  concrete benefits of  using FLOSS.

Actually I came from open content and alternative licensing to the  technical side of using GNU/Linux. My main motivation right now is the possibility to develop a deeper relationship with my tools. For me it is interesting to create my own tools for my work, rather than to use something predefined. Something everyone else uses. With free software this is easier to invent  tools. Another important point is that with free software and open standards it's more likely that you will be able to keep track of your work. With proprietary software and  formats, you are pretty much dependent on decisions of  a software company. If the company decides that it will not continue an application or format, there is not much you can do about it. This happened to users of _Freehand_ .  When Adobe acquired their competitor Macromedia they decided to discontinue the development of _Freehand_ in favour of their own product _Illustrator_. You can sign a petition, but if there is no commercial interest, most probably nothing will happen. Let's see what happens to Flash.

I studied sculpture, which is kind of very solitary way of working. Already through my studies, I thought that this idea of an artist sitting around in a studio somewhere, being by himself, just doing his   work by himself, didn't make sense to me. It is maybe true to certain   people, but it is definitely not true to me today, the person I am. I   always integrated other people into my work, or have a collaborative   work. I don't really care about this 'it is my work or your work', if   you do something together, at some-point the work exists by itself. For   me, that's the greatest moment, it is just independent. It actually   rejoins the authorship question, because I don't think you can own   ideas. You can kind of put them out there and share them. 
It  is like  organic, it is like things that can grow and that they will  become  bigger and bigger, become something else that you couldn't have  ever  thought. It makes the horizon much bigger. It is a different way  of  working I guess. I don't want to compare one with the others.
I  have  always observed when I work with other people together,  sometimes  confrontation is really hard, but it is quite interesting  also to  confront yourself with 

Obvious reason is that it is free . Not because it is free,  because   that sharing philosophy is really at the core of it. I have always   thought that when you share things, you do not get back things at   instantly, but like you do get so much things in another way, not in  the  way you expected. But if you put in a idea out, use the tools that  are  open and you use them and re-change them, put them out again. So  there  is lot of back and forth of communication.I think that is super   important for all of us to evolve. It is the idea of we evolve  together,  not just by ourselves. I really do believe that we do evolve  much  quicker if we are together than everybody trying to do things by  his or  herselves. I think it is very European idea to get into this   individualism, this thinking of 'idea of doing things by myself, my   thing'. But I think we can learn a lot from Asia, just ways of doing,   because community is much more important.

John: I don’t necessarily develop like software or codes, because I am not a    software developer. But I would say, I am involved in analog way. I do    use open source softwares, although, I have to say I do not much with    computers. Most of my work is analog-based. But I do my researches on    the website. I am a user.

I started to develop antipathy against large corporates, operating    systems, or softwares, and started to look for alternatives. Then you    come to the Linux system and Ubuntu which is very user-friendly    interface. I like the fact that the software I am using there is a   whole  community behind it, who are until now without major financial    interests and who develops tools for people like me. So now I am   totally  into open source softwares, and I try to use as much as I can.   So my  motivation would be I want to get off the track of big  corporates  who  will always kind of lead you into consuming more of  their  products.

What does Free Culture mean to you? In the sense that you use open softwares daliy basis, are you taking part in a 'Free Culture Movement'?


% NOWSPEAKING: MM
% ---------------------------
I'd like to think so, what I had realised of myself is that it is quite  hard. Only now, I am seriously trying to really contribute  back    to  projects and I wouldn't even say that I am really an  active    contributer  to free software projects. I am much more of a  user and    part of the  system. I am using it in my teaching and my  work, but now    as I try to  maybe release software in some way or try  create  projects   that are  people could actually use. I think it is  another  kind of   dimension of  engagement. I haven't really fully  realised, so  yes for   that question if  I am contributing to free  culture. Yes, but I  could  go  lot deeper.

Copyright has become much more enforced over the last years than it was ever before. In a way, culture is being absorbed by companies trying to make money out of it. And Free Culture came out as a counter movement against  this. 
When  it comes to mainstream culture, you are most often reduced to a  consumer of culture. Free Culture then is a obvious reaction. The  idea of culture where you have the possibility to engage again,  to  become active and create your version, not  just to consume content . 


% NOWSPEAKING: JC
% ---------------------------
I am a big supportive of the idea of Free Culture. I think information should be available for people, specially for those who have little access to    information. I mean we live in the west we have access to information    more or less with physical libraries and institutions where we can go. Specially in Asia, South America, Africa are very important. There is a big gap between those who have access to knowledge and those don’t  have access to knowledge.

That’s a big field to explore to be able to  open up information to people  who  have very poor access to information.  Maybe they are not even able  to  write or read. That’s already is a big  handicap. So I think it is a  big  mission in that sense. Even in the  west, we should have a full  right  to access of information which is  shaping your life.

Could Free Culture exist in absolute term/self as opposed to commercialism?


% NOWSPEAKING: MM
% -------------------------
It is a tricky question. I think no matter what, it is always the thing about like if you go down the stack, in terms of software and hardware, that is always that you get down to the deepest level of computer and then indeed there is little free kind of CPU design. So I think it is really important to be able to work in this kind of  hybrid  spaces and to  be aware of then how free free is, and always look for  kind of  alternitives when they are available. But to a  certain degree, I  think  it is really hard to took off for a total  absolute. Or it is a  decision,  you can go absolute but that may mean  that you are really  sort of  isolated from other communities. So that's  always a bit of  balancing act  like how independent can you be, how  independent you want  to be, how  big does your audience need to be, or  you community needs  to be. So  that's a lot of different decisions.  Certainly, when I am  working in the  context of kind of an art school  wtih design  practitioners, you know it  is not always possible to  really go  completely independent and there is  lots of implications in  terms of  how you work and whom you can work,  and the printers you can  work with.  So it is always a little bit of  trade-off, but as long as   understanding what the decisions are.

% -------------------------
I think the idea of a free  culture movement is very exciting and   important. It has always gone on,  but stating it in copyright-aware   terms issues an important challenge to  the 'all rights reserved'   status-quo. At the same time I think it has  limitations, at least in   its current form. I'm not sure that rich white  kids playing with their   laptops is necessarily a radical act.  The idea  and the intention are   very powerful though, because it does have the  potential to challenge   the way that power - in the form of 'intellectual  property' - is distributed.

How could open source software be economically sustainable, in a way that is  beneficial for both developers/creators and users?


% NOWSPEAKING: EG
% ----------------------------
That's   a good question!  A very hard one.  I'm not involved enough in  that   community to really comment on its  economic future. But it  does, to  me,  highlight what is missing from the  analysis in free  culture  discourse -  ie, economic reality. It  depends on where they  (developers) work. A lot of them are  employed  by  companies so they  get a salary. Others do it for a hobby.  I'd be interested to get  accurate data on what percentage of FLOSS  developers   are getting  paid, etc. In the absence of that data, I tink  it's fair to   say it's  an unsolved problem. If we think that developers  /should/ be    compensated for their work, then we need to talk about  capitalism. Or   at  least, statutory funding models.

Michael:   It is interesting that you used both 'sustainability'  and 'economic viability'. And I think those are two things very often  in opposition.  I  am doing a project now about publishing workflows and  sort of  future  electronic publishing forums. And, that was the one thing  we  looked at.  There were several solutions on the market. One was   platform called  'Editorial' which was very nice website that you could   type in, sort of  mark down texts which is particularily kind of   structured texts, and  then it would produce texts that could be done   collabratively, and then  it could produce ePub format books. After  about  six months of running,  it closed down as many platforms do.   Interestingly, in their sign off  website message, 'you have a month to   get your stuff out of the  website, and sorry we have decided not to   opensource the project'. 'As  much as we loved making it, it was just  too  much work for us to keep  this running'. And so you know that's   interesting in this way that in  terms of real sustainability, open   source of course allows them working  with somebody even if it is just  a  hobby or at least

It is very related to passion of doing these things. Now there is a project coming up called 'Embroider Murder' (??). It is on    embroidering machines which have copyrighted softwares installed. The software itself is very expensive, around 1000 euros, and the  software   for professionals is 6000 euros to buy. Embroidering machines  are very   expensive themselves too. These softwares are very tight and  closed,  you  even have to have special USB key and everything for  patterns. And   there is this two guys who are software developers, they  are trying to   come up with a format which all embroidering machines  could read. They   take their time to do this and I think in the end if  the project works   out, they will probably get an attention and  porbably get paid also.   Because instead of giving 1000 euros to  copyrighted software, maybe you   would be happy to give llets say 50  euros to these people.
