<abstract>Wie lassen sich schwierige Themen einfach darstellen? Ralph Caspers erzählt von seiner Arbeit bei „Wissen macht Ah!“ und „Die Sendung mit der Maus“ und erläutert die Methoden, die benutzt werden, um selbst schwierigste Kost leicht verdaulich zu machen. (Es hat viel mit Spucke zu tun. Deshalb sollten die Zuschauer in der ersten Reihe Regenzeug mitnehmen. Think: Sea-World!)</abstract>

<abstract>20 Jahre c-base. Insider packen aus. Ein Abriss über die bewegte Geschichte der abgestürzten Raumstation unter Berlin Mitte.</abstract>
<description>Die Geschichte der c-base ist eine Geschichte voller Missverständnisse.

Am 13.8.1995 wurde die Gründungsurkunde des c-base e.V. von 17 wissenschaftlichen Experten unterzeichnet. Seitdem haben sich viele Halbwahrheiten, Lügen und Unterstellungen sowie Mythen und Gerüchte verbreitet. (FAKT). 

Im Rahmen unserer Transparenzoffensive nehmen wir das Jubiläum zum Anlass, bisher unveröffentlichte Zahlen und Fakten darzulegen und Hintergründe zu beleuchten. Als weiterer Baustein der Transparenzoffensive präsentieren wir das c-booc, einen Bildband und historisches Archivmaterial erstmalig der Öffentlichkeit.

In einer chronologischen Auflistung der Ereignisse der letzten zwei Dekaden bringen Insider die Wahrheit™ ans Tageslicht.

<title>How To Become A Space Hacker</title>
<subtitle>(let's hack OUTER space, the final frontier)</subtitle>
<track>Science</track>
<type>lecture</type>
<language>en</language>
<abstract>Forget hacking the planet - let's HACK THE UNIVERSE.

In 2012, the world's leading space agency began a program that opened a gateway to outer space for citizen scientists - the NASA International Space Apps Challenge. Since then, tens of thousands of people have joined a global community that solves problems to improve life on Earth and in space. Learn how you too can become a space hacker!</abstract>
<description>Outer space was once the sole province of nation-states and their military-industrial complexes, even serving as a theater for the Cold War between superpowers. In recent times, thanks to scientific advancements, reduced manufacturing costs, and increased sophistication in technology and materials, space science has become more commercially and publicly accessible now than in any other time in history - and many private individuals are taking the exploration of space into their own hands, often in direct partnership with formerly unapproachable government agencies.

A new wave of administrators and executives in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have made great strides in releasing software and hardware technologies used in their space program, as well as the data and imagery produced by their missions, into the worldwide public domain. One of the most successful efforts on their part is the annually occurring grassroots, volunteer-run, community organized space hacker event known as the International Space Apps Challenge.

In just three short years, this global citizen effort has created decades of work product worth tens of millions of dollars, all geared towards creating free and open solutions to challenges that will improve life on Earth and in space.

New York City has been the &quot;global mainstage&quot; for the International Space Apps Challenge for two years running, hosted by its local chapter of space hackers: Space Apps NYC. At 1200 members and growing, Space Apps NYC is one of the world's premiere space hacker communities. Over 100 open source projects have been created by its members, and in 2015 their locally organized event included NASA's &quot;Women in Data&quot; bootcamp and a conference program of renowned speakers livestreamed worldwide.

This talk will cover some of the highlights and history of &quot;the galaxy's biggest hackathon&quot;, describe and demonstrate some of the best projects created, and discuss the NASA resources that are made freely available for anyone in the world to use for any purpose.</description>

<abstract>Die Störerhaftung verhindert bisher oft, dass Unternehmen und Private in Deutschland offene Funknetzwerke anbieten. Die Digiges hat daher schon vor drei Jahren einen Gesetzentwurf vorgestellt, wie man die Rechtslage fixen kann, der auch im Bundestag beraten wird. Leider hat sich in der Bundesregierung aber die Betonkopf-Fraktion durchgesetzt, sodass dem Digiges-Entwurf ein WLAN-Verhinderungsgesetz der Großen Koalition entgegengesetzt wurde. Der Talk fasst zusammen, welche Haftungsrisiken es derzeit gibt, warum der Gesetzentwurf der Bundesregierung die Lage deutlich verschlechtern würde und was man trotzdem tun kann, um sein Netz rechtssicher öffnen zu können.</abstract>

<description>After the Snowden revelations, demand for encrypted end-to-end communication has skyrocketed, even amongst ordinary users. As also shown by the catastrophic fate of Lavabit, running a high-security communications provider is fraught with danger, both political and technical. Yet today we see services that essentially sell security &quot;snake oil&quot; taking off with users, while real end-to-end encryption is barely used by activists, much less ordinary people. We still have do not have widespread deployment of OpenPGP, and post-email messaging protocols such as OpenWhisper still have less than a million users. Fundamental standards such as OpenPGP existing for over thirty years, but software such as Enigmail is still claimed to be virtually unusable. What is the source of this massive failure, and how can it be fixed? 

 How can we combat the fundamental problems afflicting encrypted messaging, from e-mail to beyond, so that it becomes a fundamental right for all people to have end-to-end encrypted messaging? This roundtable will bring together software projects working in this space to reflect on their future, debate their differences, and possibly develop a common strategy for the future. Questions to be addressed are:

1.  Are standards the solution or the problem? The IETF has recently re-opened the OpenPGP mailing list, and there is discussion around the Darkmail (DIME) protocols brewing. However, even the OpenPGP Working Group is not tackling the hard problems of metadata protection. Another strategy is to ditch e-mail entirely and go with new protocols such as TextSecure, but these protocols are still not federated and are thus centralized with particular applications. Decentralized blockchain-based messaging alternatives have also not taken off.

2. Why is the software still unusable by ordinary users? Two years onwards, we still do not have a better interface than Thunderbird, which has been abandoned by Mozilla. Mailpile is still in beta. Pixelated is still under development. Furthermore, how do we communicate to users if their messages are secure or not?

3. What research problems remain open? Currently, e-mail leaks metadata through the header, as well as through timing information and network traffic. Keyservers remain broken in terms of authentication and also reveal the social graph while key revocation and signing is difficult. Academic work on mix networking and privacy-enhancing technologies desperately needs to 

4. How can we reach critical mass? Some companies such as OpenWhisper are now working with major providers such as WhatsApp. Others such as LEAP are working so that anyone can run their own provider. Start-ups such as Peer.io and Protonmail are pursuing centralized strategies, and even Gmail and Yahoo! are working on end-to-end encryption. Governments such as Brazil and Germany are pushing for nationalized or public-private partnerships for encrypted email, while business models in the 'privacy market' are still unclear at best and seem to be unable to take into account distributed systems. 

The goal of this even is to bring together key voices in this space so we combat the fundamental problems afflicting encrypted messaging, from e-mail to beyond, so that it becomes a fundamental right for all people to have end-to-end encrypted messaging.

<abstract>Tools for encryption and circumventing censorship have developed a reputation for being confusing and difficult to use. Difficulty using tools has led to users in sensitive situations giving up on encrypting or misunderstanding how to do it, putting them at risk. What are the best ways to improve usability in free and open-source projects? Gus will discuss her experience doing usability work with developers of FLOSS tools like Mailpile, Bitmask, Enigmail, and Jitsi, suggesting some practices which have been obstacles to usability and others which support the development of great, usable interfaces.</abstract>
<description>Tools for encryption and circumventing censorship have developed a reputation for being confusing and difficult to use — and not for no reason. Managing encryption keys, understanding trust certificates, and estimating threats can be difficult even for expert users. Difficulty using tools has led to users in sensitive situations giving up on encrypting or misunderstanding how to do it, and subsequently being arrested when their communications are intercepted.

With increasing surveillance from governments and with corporate data breaches, there has been increasing interest in making it easier to help everyday people — as well as journalists, activists, and hackers — protect their privacy and security with free and open source tools. Funding to support usability work by FLOSS developers is increasingly available. But what are the best ways to improve usability in free and open-source projects, which may not have the budget of commercial software developers?

In this talk, Gus will discuss her experience doing usability work with developers of FLOSS tools like Mailpile, Bitmask, Enigmail, and Jitsi, which she has done at the Open Internet Tools Project and now the secure UX organization Simply Secure. She will describe successful experiences helping developers understand their users, common obstacles and developer habits which make software less usable, simple ways in which developers can incorporate UX into their practices more easily, and FLOSS development practices which support better usability.</description>

<abstract>Peñabots have been active in Mexican networks since the 2012 presidential elections. Named after President Enrique Peña Nieto, armies of bots have become a political weapon to combat protests and attack critics of the Mexican government online. Bots are waging a dirty war in Mexican social media. They are weaponized censors that silence dissent and cover up crimes. </abstract>
<description>Developers in Mexico are using a variety of open source tools to create visualizations which are helpful in detecting bots. They are working on new open source software to stop the botnets that have taken over Mexican social media, but they need help. 

I’ve observed several different bot activities in Mexican twitter. I break them down into 5 categories:

1. Hashtag spamming
2. Making artificial trends
3. Smear campaigns (against media, individual journalists &amp; protesters) 4. Death threat campaigns
5. Political propaganda

<subtitle>Funding open source with money from corporations and governments</subtitle>
<track>Ethics, Society &amp; Politics</track>
<type>lecture</type>
<language>en</language>
<abstract>Increasingly, there is money available to fund free software projects; however it often comes from large organizations, governments, and corporations, who all have their own goals and missions. The question becomes, if you decide to work with these groups, is it possible for your project to maintain a set of goals and ethics that are its own? Members of the Open Technology Institute will draw on our experiences in partnering with large interested funders (US Government, Google), and facilitate an audience discussion of how this funding model can work, the challenges that can arise and the complicated ethics around it.
</abstract>
<description>Creating complicated multi-layered open source projects requires development, maintenance and ongoing commitments. Often, to do these things you need money. Paying developers and hackers can be a way for a project to work towards quality and sustainability, assuring that people have time to fix to bugs, handle support and work with others.

There is increasingly money available; however it often comes from source like governments, major tech companies, universities, and large foundations.  Each have their own missions and goals that are likely distinct from those of your project. The question becomes, if you decide to work with these funders, is it possible for your project to create and maintain a set of goals that are its own?

To be sure, this is not the only way to fund a project, and it is not a good fit for all projects. However, it is a choice that many have made. We want to have a discussion about that choice. Drawing on our experiences in partnerships with USAID (for Commotion Wireless), as well as Google (for the Measurement Lab), members of the Open Technology Institute want to share what we've learned, and facilitate a discussion on what it means to make the choice to pursue these types of funding.

We want this to be a broad discussion, with people who have made similar choices (or as importantly the opposite ones), and not a sales pitch for the choices our organization has made. We've discussed this at length amongst ourselves, and are curious to hear what CCC has to say.

Some questions that we would like to see frame the discussion are:
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is taking funding from governments and/or giant corporations to fund free software ethical at all?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If so, how do you decide your project's limits?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do you figure out where your goals align or overlap with a funder's goals in ways that are helpful to your project?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do you respond to allegations that your are doing your funder's dirty work? (ie: the assumption that you are putting backdoors in your code because you are taking money from a government)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<title>Real Vegan Cheese</title>
<subtitle>Engineering yeast to produce casein</subtitle>
<track>Science</track>
<type>lecture</type>
<language>en</language>
<abstract>I will present the story and science behind this project, which is aimed at producing milk proteins in yeast.  If we succeed we will be able to make vegan cheese which is indistinguishable from animal derived cheese.  This project is run out of two hacker spaces in the SF bay area.</abstract>
<description>Production of milk is an incredibly energy, water and land intensive industry.  Couple that with spawning of antibiotic resistant bacteria caused by modern farming practices, along with the suffering of the animals themselves, and it's a full blown disaster.  At the same time, cheese is often cited by people as the reason they could never go vegan.  Vegan cheese substitutes have been increasing in quality, but still are not satisfying for many people.
  In the modern age of genetic engineering, however, animals should not be needed to produce cheese.  It is a single protein complex, casein, which is responsible for most of cheese's properties such as melting and stretching.  The genes responsible for producing casein are sequenced for many animals, and so it should be possible to engineer other organisms, such as yeast, to make casein as well.  This is the goal of the Real Vegan Cheese project.
  This project started in the spring of 2014 as a collaboration between Biocurious in Sunnyvale, CA and Counter Culture Labs in Oakland, CA.  Beyond the goal of producing a real cheese in a vegan process, we also formed to enter the international genetically engineered machines competition and show that community labs could compete with academic labs (tl;dr we won), and to provide alternative educational pathways for people interested in learning genetic engineering.  I will give an overview of the progress on these different aspects of our project including details of the science behind the project and current and future challenges.</description>

<abstract>Starting my new job, I was surprised about my colleagues reactions to my mistakes. No blame! People trust me to own my mistakes and fix them! Complex systems are brittle. Developers work in a constant state of new things-not-quite-working-yet. Programming in pairs and code reviews help us. But what about the quality of human interaction? How can we build a culture of blamelessness and why is it crucial for learning and for brave decision making?</abstract>
<description>On the first day of my new job, I contributed program code that went live to the website we are building. After a month, I contributed some code that caused alerts. I felt bad and it was reverted quickly, never making it to the site. Still, I was surprised about how my colleagues reacted. They did not blame me! I felt support. These people have got my back. I experienced that it is okay to make mistakes and people trust me to fix them. After my years in gradschool this was a refreshingly new experience! Just two weeks ago, somebody within the company received the annual prize, our three-armed-sweater, for the most spectacular way to bring down the site. We joked that if somebody does not break the site to get the prize, they are not daring enough in their coding. I am still nervous when pushing new code to the site, but it feels like an exciting anticipation and respect for my work.

People working with complex systems know they are brittle, because they are complex. Code that works well is nice, but working code also means everything is done - how boring! Programmers and builders live in a constant state of things-not-quite-working-yet, pushing this boundary every day. Even though it might be just software, this can be a challenging environment.

Programming culture is rife with stereotypes of lone-wolf coders. On hacker news, people like to &quot;well-actually&quot; each other. I did it, and maybe you do it too. Quite often, we face our coding questions all alone. With computers, we fight unforgiving machines, and usually the mistakes in our systems are based on human decisions. Programming in pairs and code reviews are techniques to improve these decisions by adding an extra set of eyes and opinions. These tools are excellent to use when working on a challenging complex system together and are known techniques by now.

But what about the quality of human interaction? How can we build a culture of blamelessness and why is it crucial for learning and brave decision making?</description>

<subtitle>A Practical Introduction to Acoustic Cryptanalysis</subtitle>
<track>Science</track>
<type>lecture</type>
<language>en</language>
<abstract>In this talk we provide a practical introduction to Acoustic Cryptanalysis using tools and techniques that are easily grasped and cheaply available. The intention is not to present any new results, but instead the emphasis is on gaining a foundation in the theory of such attacks, so that you will be able to apply them more effectively in more challenging scenarios. As we shall see, such attacks are an extension of other types of side-channel attack (timing and power analysis attacks in particular), with the added promise of bridging air gaps.</abstract>
<description>We open by introducing the subject of side-channel attacks with a short review of them in general, and focus on key examples of acoustic cryptanalysis in the literature, including analysis of keyboard emanations, a brief look at an historical account of an attack on the Hagelin cipher machine that played a critical role in the Suez Crisis of the 1950's and the more recent results of Genkin, Shamir and Tromer, which forms the primary basis and inspiration of the techniques we will discuss.
We start the technical section of our talk by giving a background to power supplies for microcomputer systems, initially reviewing linear power supplies, so we have a basis on which we can compare them to the operating principles of switch-mode power supplies that form the key element of acoustic attacks. Along the way, we look at the important design principle of feedback and the relation this has to frequency response, which in turn gives us an estimate of the bandwidth of emanated signal available to us. Then, we explore the mechanisms by which key components of switch-mode power supplies can be caused to generate unwanted acoustics, show just how readily they will do so and how rich the spectral content of such signals can be.
Our next task will be to look at signal acquisition techniques, where we scratch build an ultrasonic USB microphone with 125kHz of bandwidth, for a price at least two orders of magnitude cheaper than commercially available alternatives, yet still sensitive enough to capture the signals of interest. Specifically, we survey options for transducers, the design of the analog signal path and take a look at high data throughput techniques based on DMA to ensure that we can maintain the data rates required. We then discuss difficulties encountered in getting our signal from our data acquisition board into our data analysis system.
Since a considerable amount of the literature on side-channel attacks, particularly simple and differential power analysis attacks, deals with attacks on block ciphers such the Advanced Encryption Standard, rather than public key cryptosystems such as RSA (as dealt with in the Genkin, Shamir and Tromer paper), the focus of our attack will be AES. We will quickly review the processing steps involved in AES and then develop a naive implementation of AES-128, paying particular attention to the construction of the S-boxes, since the data-dependent lookup times are the source of timing variations. Our attack is essentially an adaptation of the classic cache timing attack described by Daniel J. Bernstein, where the leaked timing information is obtained instead via the acoustic channel. Our target machine will be a netbook with an Intel Atom N270 (24kB L1 cache, 512KB L2 cache) together with a cheap and particularly noisy AC power supply (model PA-1700-02). We will discuss passive techniques to improve sound amplification in our test setup which will be familar to anyone who has played a stringed musical instrument.
Finally, we move into the data processing and attack implementation section of the talk. In order to determine the run-time of our AES implementation for a given key, we will first need to be able to distinguish the difference in acoustic emanation of the system under load, compared to the idle-load condition. To do this, we will use the discrete-time Fourier transform of the acoustic signal, focusing on a suitable band of frequencies, where changes in amplitude correlate with CPU load changes. This will involve a discussion of the choice of FFT frame size against spectral resolution, choice of suitable windowing function and filtering techniques, to enable us to distinguish more accurately the transition from idle-load to load states.
The attack itself is conducted along the same lines as Bernstein's, with the victim machine running the AES process as a server to which we send UDP packets from our analysis machine, with plaintexts that are then encrypted by the server using its private key. The attack proceeds in two phases. The first involves using known keys and measuring the aggregate encryption time of each, thereby gathering statistics about key-dependent biases in the runtimes. In the second phase, the server chooses a random key which we are not told and we use the previously gathered statistics, together with data from a large sample of suitably chosen plaintexts, that we send to determine bit-by-bit the unknown private key. We spend some time considering options for statistical analyses that might lead to a possible reduction in the number of samples necessary to extract the complete key.
Concluding the talk we discuss standard techniques to mitigate side-channel attacks found in the literature, as well as possible further extensions of the attack presented. It is hoped this will set the scene for the discussion section of the talk, where these ideas can be explored further.</description>

<track>Ethics, Society &amp; Politics</track>
<type>lecture</type>
<language>en</language>
<abstract>The presentation of the Hackerspace Design Patterns at CCCamp 2007 / 24C3 started the international hackerspace movement!  These patterns described what has worked well, and not worked well, for the 40 or so hackerspaces existing at the time.  Now that over 2,000 have blossomed all over the planet, it is time to add Patterns from this collective experience.</abstract>
<description>In 2007 there were about 40 hackerspaces in the world, mostly in Germany.  From their research of what worked well, and what did not work so well, at these hackerspaces, 3 German hackers created the Hackerspace Design Patterns.  Their presentation at CCCamp 2007 and 24C3 directly inspired the creation of several more hackerspaces, thus triggering an exponential growth of hackerspaces worldwide.

Now, with over 2,000 hackerspaces listed on hackerspaces.org (a networking website that was also inspired by the original Patterns), it is time for the international hackerspace movement to benefit from this broad and diverse experience.

Mitch Altman has visited about 250 hackerspaces worldwide, where he has gained collective knowledge from people at these spaces.  He also co-founded Noisebridge, where he gained first-hand experience of what has worked well, and not worked so well, at that space.  He would now like to share this collective experience to the world to help the next several years of hackerspaces with the expanded:  Hackerspace Design Patterns 2.0 .

A workshop will take place immediately following this talk to deep-dive into the topic and for many of us to share our collective experience for the benefit of all.</description>

<subtitle>a creative drink for the commons</subtitle>
<track>Failosophy</track>
<type>lecture</type>
<language>en</language>
<abstract>Mier a creative commons Mate Beer that was launched in Berlin in 2012 made some waves as it tried to pave a path reserved only for software.  In this presentation Fabricio, from Meta Mate describes the ideas behind and challenges met in launching a CC NC 3.0SA drink inspired by the commons with mate.</abstract>
<description>Mier could be considered  a failed attempted where a  CC 
open source license could not break through in Germany without 
extra capital and risks. And the notion of a CC license on a product was completely misunderstood in the mainstream and creative commons circles.  
As a concept the drink made break throughs, a decentrally produced beer with mate to keep drinkers alert, that could be easily reproduced according to local tastes and supported decentralized production of Mate.  Perhaps this was too much of a threat to the brewing industry, whose 500 year celebration of the German brewing Purity Law, is ensuring that creative hacks in the standard beer recipe remain miminal.
The topic is kind of cheesy but provides a light edge in a serious theme demonstrating that an art business approach that gets lots of press can fail badly. 
Mier had some wonderful moments including attention from all of the mainstream press and being presented at EHSM 2011 and as well as being highlighted in a 1337kultur.de podcast. 
But it has Failed (at least until now).

During this event Fabricio will share the history of Mier, the examples of how brewers misunderstood the open source concept behind it and outline the possible future steps including the creation of DIY Mier Brewing kits for the fans.

<abstract>Fern ab von Theorien zu Killerrobotern und der Privatssphärendebatte, die dem Machine Learning 2.0 seit den 2010ern anhängen; schaffen wir künstlerische Intelligenz: einen Algorithmus, der Gedichte generiert. Basierend auf einer Technik, die die Funktionsweise des menschlichen Gehirns grundlegend nachahmt, lehren wir einer Maschine zu reimen wie Goethe und Schiller oder KIZ und Sido. Die selbe Technik und deren Weiterentwicklung lassen sich seit 2012 Google und Facebook einiges kosten. Die Rede ist vom Deep Learning. Als Enthusiasten in diesem Bereich möchten wir zeigen, was man mit Deep Learning alles tun kann außer Gesichter erschreckend gut zu erkennen. 
Zudem wollen wir die Zuschauer anregen über Mensch und Maschine und deren Bewusstsein und Interaktion zu philosophieren. Wenn das Experiment gelingt verschwimmen die Grenzen der Protagonisten. Zuschauer können live Gedichte mit eigenem Input vom Algorithmus generieren lassen.</abstract>
<description>In the context of a machine supported orchestra/band, when writing song texts, I figured they are all are quiet alike. So I was wondering if I could make a machine that could do my job or even better: Creating new text from looking at artists that I like or whom's combination I imagine to be fun.

So here is the approach: We take an LSTM recurrent neural network (non-linear directed cycles with internal memory) and train (=adjust internal weights) it syllable-wise on Wikipedia [1]. The model will compute the probability of the next word given the previous words. The weights that we trained on Wikipedia will serve as a prior for our actual model i.e. we continue training with our own text e.g. Goethe or KIZ. 

When training is done we can generate an entire song text  by giving the model a random or chosen word/phrase. We can also interrupt at any point, change phrases and the model will react on that. Its interesting to see if it can learn rhythms and rhymes from syllables.

For the camp that's as much as  we want to present. In a larger context, the resulting texts are supposed to be performed by humans in contrast to the by now overused approach to let a computer read human written text.</description>

<language>en</language>
<abstract>This talk is given by three activists who were all targeted by UK police spy Mark Kennedy and who have direct personal experience of that and other physical surveillance. It will look at experiences of infiltration of social  justice movements by the state and private contractors and some of our  responses. </abstract>
<description>Over the past 5 years there has been an avalanche of revelations about the use of undercover agents against political movements: infiltrators that spend decades living and working with us, forming the most intimate relationships and accessing every single part of our lives. Infiltrators have been uncovered within political mobilisations in the UK, Germany, the USA, New Zealand, Spain etc., showing us that understanding offline security is just as vital as making our hardware and software secure. No matter how many layers of encryption we use, if our closest companions are infiltrators, sharing our homes, our lives, and our computers, there is nowhere to hide.
   
This talk is given by three activists who were all targeted by UK police spy Mark Kennedy and who have direct personal experience of that and other physical surveillance. It will look at experiences of infiltration of social justice movements by the state and private contractors, some of our responses, and how that might relate to digital privacy struggles and resistance to other parts of the surveillance state

In an increasingly murky world of mass surveillance, cross-border cooperation, and political policing in the &quot;war on Terror&quot;, these flesh-and-blood undercover agents may be working for the state police or secret services, or come from the increasingly large market of private surveillance contractors.  A report on policing published in 2014 in the UK estimated  that in that country alone there are currently 1,229 of undercover police officers operating both on and offline. 

If you believe that mass surveillance is wrong but targeted surveillance is necessary; if you believe you will not be targeted because you are not a dissident (or you just make tools for dissidents!); if you have ever thought you are too ineffectual to be of interest to the political police, then this talk is for you. This happened to us because we did not imagine the lengths they would go to, and we are speaking out because if people know this is happening they are forewarned and forearmed against it.

<abstract>Since the start of the Hacker Space Program in 2011 we had some progress but space has not been reached yet. We will report on our ongoing efforts to reach the Karman-line using sounding rockets.</abstract>
<description>The Kármán Line is defined as the distance from the Earth's surface where aerodynamic forces become too small to steer a vehicle. It has been defined by the FAI to be located at 100km above ground and is the official boundary between Earth and space. The logical first step to orbitalise any object is therefore to cross this line. We will report on our recent activities with sounding rockets, our progress in coming closer to the Kármán Line and on which projects we will focus in the near future.</description>

<subtitle>Creating a usable tool against online trackers</subtitle>
<track>Science</track>
<type>lecture</type>
<language>en</language>
<abstract>Today's websites and mobile applications heavily rely on third party libraries: to display advertisement, to enable social networking, and to analyze their audience. The convenience of these third party libraries comes at the cost of privacy violations for their users. A number of blocking-tools tackle this privacy issue including Adblock Plus and Ghostery. In this talk we present an analysis on the effectiveness of today's blocking tools. These blocking-tools focus to a large extend on the traditional Desktop web-browser, while at the same time a global shift towards mobile devices can be observed. We present our open source project, called Usable Privacy Box (upribox), which aims to make tracker-blocking on mobile devices easy and usable.</abstract>
<description>The talk starts of with a brief introduction on state-of-the-art methods to track users online. Hereby, we discuss traditional tracking cookies, super cookies, as well as fingerprinting. This first part should set the stage for our research and the goals of our privacy tool, and provide an overview on current research in the area of user tracking. The second part presents the primarily results of our study on user tracking. Our study analyzed the effectiveness of today's tracker-blocking extensions on popular websites and Android applications. Finally, we present the Usable Privacy Box (upribox), which aims at making the protection against user tracking as easy as possible. The upribox creates its own Wifi network and filters advertisement and trackers transparently, without requiring additional configuration.</description>

<abstract>When you plan to send a rover to the moon, there are many things that can go wrong. Some are technical glitches, other are from the organisation. With an Analogue Mission Simulation we try to find those glitches before landing on the moon. In this presentation we plan to talk about the how, why and the neat technical challenges that come with such an event.</abstract>
<description>An analogue mission simulation (AMS) tries to re-create the simulation as close as possible in a controlled environment. It covers simple things like:
 - What is the first thing to do when you land on the moon?
 - How hard is it to remote-control a vehicle in an unknown terrain when the connection sucks?
 - How can you deal with the delay in communication?
 - How well can you evaluate the risk involved in driving in certain terrains?
 - How hard is it to get unstuck when you only have the two main cameras?

While we do not know the answers to that question a-priori, the goal of the AMS is to find answers to those. But there are also several technical challenges that need to be overcome, and new technologies that need to be tested.</description>

<title>Data and discrimination: representing marginalised communities in data</title>
<subtitle>The right to be counted, or the right to be left alone?</subtitle>
<track>Ethics, Society &amp; Politics</track>
<type>lecture</type>
<language>en</language>
<abstract>In the past, marginalised communities have often been left uncounted when it comes to institutional datasets. Some argue that the right to be counted is a crucial step to addressing the needs of marginalised communities; but for others, the exact opposite is true. Anonymity and not being reflected in data is exactly what some communities want, and need. In this talk, I'll discuss both sides of the argument, with concrete examples of how the different strategies have been used in various situations. </abstract>
<description>For some marginalised communities, not being represented in certain institutional datasets means their needs don't have a chance of being met. The first step for changing this, for many anti-discrimination campaigners, is to be counted and to appear in those datasets, and thus have a chance at being reflected in decision making that might stem from the data.

In the eyes of many privacy campaigners, though, the exact opposite is true. Being reflected in data might do more harm to those marginalised communities, for whom operating under the radar or anonymously might be crucial to their livelihoods. 

What can we learn from the way in which different marginalised communities have been reflected in data in the past? When discriminatory decisions have been made as a result of unrepresentative datasets, at what point were the mistakes made, and how could they have been mitigated?

<abstract>The lack of women in tech is evident in numbers and our experience. This imbalance has been in the focus of a public discussion, that has become increasingly difficult to follow and fueled by false accusations or false.

So let's get together and try to understand what the underlying reasons are and what we can do to create a change. And most importantly ask ourselves: Why should we care? </abstract>
<description>In the past years, we have witnessed a growing concern and discussion about the lack of women in software development, tech communities and computer science. The big gender imbalance is evident in numerous statistics and our own experience, but the partly heated up discussion makes it difficult to follow. 

So what are the reasons for the imbalance and what can we do about it?

In this talk we are going to learn how the presence of women in IT has changed over the course of a century. We will examine the current situation and try to understand for what reason the number of women has diminished. We will learn about the challenges, that keep women from entering the tech world and how we as key figures in the tech community can tackle these problems and learn from existing initiatives.

In the end, we'll also deal with the most pressing question: &quot;Why should we care?&quot;

Optionally, whoever is interested, is warmly welcome to join in a discussion/lunch/drinks afterwards, where we can share experience and thoughts about this in a smaller group
The results and findings presented are part of a research paper I wrote in spring 2015.</description>

<abstract>We will explain how we entered the Venture Capital sphere and what happend there, ultimatly, this effort failed. While Ijon produced Business-Bullshit and Buzzword-Bingo and jumped through hoops for Investors, Riot developed the Software HFOS, which got quite far. </abstract>
<description>The Hackerfleet is an organisation that wants to bring opensource to the seven Seas. They tried to aquire venture capital investment, but failed to do so. In this talk, they will explain what they experienced and with what (partially ridiculous) expectations they were met by investors.

During the failed monetization efforts, the softwaredevelopment continued and produced results, the HFOS (Hackerfleet Operating System) will be shown on stage. It is a locally hosted, collaborative softwaresystem for nautical professionals and amateurs. 

Think of the evolution between early officesoftware (LibreWriter) and Etherpad in terms of collaboration. HFOS is that exact same evolution, but for chart tables and navigators. 

After the monetization efforts failed, the founders have no clue what best strategy to follow from now on. They will present several ideas and organize an open discussion in the c-base village after the talk to discuss these ideas. </description>

<track>Science</track>
<type>lecture</type>
<language>en</language>
<abstract>This talk introduces the concept of experimental, educational and production centers which focus on fermentation arts and science. The range of the topics to cover is huge from new approaches in beer making, building up incubators to make it happen too many more. The places are community run, based on the open source concept of collaborating and sharing the results of their findings, functioning as a topical hackerspaces. They have strong ties with local communities in places where they are based, which needs they are trying to fulfill. They aim to collaborate internationally to promote this network of independent centers by strengthening the knowledge exchange by variety of means. We present both freshly established “facts on the ground“ and also the theoretical framework for creating new places and interlinking them together. Combining the fermentation arts of our ancestors, today’s science achievements with tomorrow’s technology is the aim!</abstract>
<description>In these days there are many newcomers to the hacker movement. Facilities which would focus primarily on food and drink biotech following the basic hacker standards like independent forms of funding, open source collaboration etc. have been few if not missing in the movement so far. This talk is going to explain why is it important to have them - food &amp; drink biotech is a huge sector where mostly corporate doctrines ruled so far, having minimal ethical and moral challengers, therefore building up a know how fallowing the principles described above is crucial. This presentation will describe how the centers can be started based on previous experience. It will discuss variety of options how to get funding to open its doors and consequently how to keep the lights on. Also the legal structure like for-profit, non-profit etc will be discussed. 

In summary the aim is to share the experience about how to start up places like this to stimulate their spread, interlinking them and helping them to prosper. It is also a call for building up place like this in Europe.  

As a demonstration fallowing project can be run by the Experimental Fermentation Institute focusing on a fermentation biotech. This project is focused on promotion and development of food sustainability in local rural communities using variety of fermentation cultures and techniques. The goal is to use the regionally available alimentary resources, preserve them in the time of abundance for periods when they are scarce and process part of them into higher value products for recreational use and trade. This is going to be achieved by selecting appropriate fermentation cultures/microbes and adequate techniques which will be combining the traditional knowledge and state of the art technology, resulting in scheme aimed on small to medium production. Fermentation facility will be designed to suit the needs of rural areas including production, educational and experimental purposes. Next step will be creation of training program which will allow to the interested participants to master these techniques and carry out the production. As the final step, the participants will be motivated to start their own businesses supporting therefore the green collar worker scheme and local economy. All of the developments in this project will be based on open source approach and shared with community. </description>

<title>The quest for artificial general intelligence</title>
<subtitle>beyond the Turing test</subtitle>
<track>Science</track>
<type>lecture</type>
<language>en</language>
<abstract>A whirlwind tour of the past, present, and future for artificial general intelligence (also known as strong AI). This talk will begin with Alan Turing's original test. This is not the same as *the* Turing test everyone has heard of. We will look at the current state of the art covering such topics as:

* How old does a human have to be to beat the current state of the art AI in answering science questions?
* What are some other ways we can test AI?
* How do we teach computers language?
* How well can AI follow a written story?
* How well can AI recognize what's in an image?
* What basic things are easy for humans to do but very difficult for AI?
* What are the common objections to the advancement of AI?
* What does the future hold?

As with anything that pushes the boundaries of what's possible, we'll also take a look at some hilarious failures with chat bots and image scene recognition.

No prior knowledge about artificial intelligence is required for this talk.</abstract>
<description>This talk will begin with a definition and a quick history of AI and some famous failed predictions. I'll cover the curious origin of Alan Turing's formulation of his test.

The talk will cover general approaches in areas like how we teach AI to understand science, language, and images. I will address persistent problems, the current state of the art, and the formalization of tests preceding and succeeding the Turing test.

The talk will conclude with the possible future and what happens after the Turing test is passed: including a discussion of whether recent caution about unconstrained AI is really warranted.</description>

<title>Detecting echoes from the dawn of time</title>
<subtitle>Nifty technologies behind the world's most sensitive astronomical detectors</subtitle>
<track>Science</track>
<type>lecture</type>
<language>en</language>
<abstract>Our understanding of the universe has exploded in the past 50 years, largely thanks to incredible advances in detector technology that allow us to precisely measure light and particles of all kinds. In this talk, I will describe some of the world's most sensitive detector technologies. These detectors often exploit strange properties of matter, or push up against the laws of physics in the most extreme physical conditions. I will also highlight the scientific discoveries that these new technologies have made possible.</abstract>
<description>Almost every great leap in understanding in science was made possible by a new technology. For example, the field of biology changed forever after the microscope revealed the existence of cells. In this talk I hope to convey some of the great technological leaps in detector technology in astronomy, and what those leaps have allowed us to learn about the nature of the universe. A small sampling of what you can expect to hear about is listed below.

My own PhD research was focused on the cosmic microwave background (remnant radiation from the big bang), which is best viewed with mm-wavelength detectors. This wavelength range is notoriously difficult to work in, and we have to operate our superconducting detectors a mere .25 degrees above absolute zero.

Other experiments aim to measure neutrinos, which are particles that almost never interact with anything. But how do you measure something that only interacts rarely with your detector? One experiment's solution is to use a several cubic kilometer slab of the Antarctic ice cap as a the detector--the &quot;just make it bigger&quot; approach.

In practice, there are always problems that crop up when working at the edges of human understanding and the laws of physics, some fundamental, and some mundane but hilarious. (Like the time all of our resistors went superconducting on us; Digikey doesn't spec resistors to temperatures within a degree of absolute zero.) I plan to discuss some of the practical problems we have had to tackle when working on cryogenics and detectors, and the sometimes unorthodox ways we have solved them. Cryogenic dental floss anyone?</description>
