So what I want to do, what this is going to be, is some kind of post on
OSP.[^]{http://ospublish.constantvzw.org} So your audience is OSP's audience.
And I would like to start from this image, this screenshot I've got from you,
with your ConTeXt tag.
Because I didn't know, you were going to go to this famous meeting, the
international ConTeXt meeting. So when I found  out, I took the picture
and now I need to know what happened.
So first is: How did you end up going to ... where was it?

% Ok, it was in Brejlov, which apparently might not even be a town  or city, 
%  it might specifically be a hotel. But it has its own ... it's considered 
% a  location, I guess. But arriving was already kind of a trick ... because 
% I  was under the impression there was a train station or something. So I 
% was  asking around: Where is Brejlov? What train do I take to Brejlov?  
% But nobody had any clue ... that this was even something that existed.  So 
% that was tricky. But ... No, it was really a beautiful venue. How I  ended 
% up at the conference specifically?  That's a good question ...  I guess 
% ... I'm not an incredibly active member on the ConTeXt mailing list,  but 
% I pop up every now and again and ... sort of ... just kind of express a  
% few things  that I had going on. So initially I mentioned my thesis, I 
% think,  back in January or  maybe March, back when it was really 
% unformated, maybe it  was  even in 2009. But I got really good responses 
% from Hans, that this  sounded like a good project and so ... And 
% originally when I first got to the  Netherlands in 2009 in August, the 
% next  weekend was the third annual  ConTeXt meeting. And I had barely used 
% the software at that point ... but  I had this sort of like impulse  to 
% go. I was in the Netherland ... I'm in  Europe ... Well anyway,  I did not 
% have the money for it at that time. So  the fact that there  was another 
% one coming round, was like: ok, that  sounds good. But there  was 
% something, I can't remember if there was some  sort of explicit ... I 
% know, that we got into a conversation on the  mailing list.  Somebody, a 
% non-native english speaker was asking about  pronouns  and gendered 
% pronouns and what the proper way of pronouning  things ... In english we 
% don't have a suitable gender neutral pronoun. So  ... he asked the 
% questions and some guy responded: the proper way to do  it, is to use he. 
% It's an invented problem.  This whole question is an  invented question 
% and there is no such thing as a need for considering any  other options 
% besides  this. So I wrote back and said: That's not up to  you to decide, 
% because if somebody has a problem, than there is a problem.  So I kind of 
% naively suggested that we could make a unicode  character,  that can stand 
% in, like a typographical element, that does not necessarily  have a 
% pronounciation yet. So something that when you are reading it you  could 
% either say he or she or they and it would be sort of like  
% XXXX[0:04:17][?]. Sort of like delayed  political correctness or delayed  
% embraciveness, or whatever. But,  a little did I know, that unicode was  
% not the answer.

Hans[^]{Hans Hagen is ...}.
% That this sounded like a good project.
Originally, when I first got to the Netherlands in 2009 in August, the

This whole question is an invented question and there is no such

% Hans or Taco, who are the main  developers. And zero on anything besides  
% ConTeXt. So it has really become sort of this ... the NTG is almost  
% presented as, ok if you like ConTeXt or if you wanna be in a ConTeXt user

Right. That's a good way to start untangling all the stuff I was just  
talking about, when I was sort of putting the cart before the horse. I see it  
developing in some ways ... the way that it's used today and the way that 
current, heavy users use it. I think that they will continue to use in  
it in a similar way. But you already have people who are utilising   
Luatex ... and maybe this is an important thing to distinguish between  
ConTeXt and Luatex. Right now they're sort of very tied together. Their  
development is intrinsic, they drive each other. But to some extent some

% I'm trying  to ... and I think if you read the 'making of' you see that 
% there is on one hand a  complete excitement if it only were the solution. 
% But unfortunately it  isn't. And for us it had, I think, a lot to do, of

% from that kind of  automatism, were I do declare a variable. So I think we 
% could have had  much more fun actually, much more excitement even, that

% definetely big issues  with flexibility when it comes to form. So I 
% understand, I very much  understand that seen from a css, html, xml, 
% working in multiple translations ... working in multiple languages at the 
% same time ... working with large  series ... flexibility is an issue and 
% is potentially ... let's say ...  ConTeXt is  very much an answer to those

% XXXX[0:44:31][?] of peer review connecting it into ...  thinking about

% whereever you want to go, that at the moment you try to break  out, the 
% system completely looses all flexibility. And it is almost as if you  can

% of what a text is on  a page. Like we had very simple examples of  trying 
% to combine different page size with different ways of treating  headers

% shouldn't put that on ConTeXt at all, because ConTeXt is quite different

% Yeah. I think that this is a ... sort of ... an interesting  position

% their answer to the questions to allow me to do my version of the  
% documentation. But I think part of it is really encouraging more of a  
% sense of ... responsability on the part of users and power users and even  
% developers, like not necessarily of the core developers, because they have 
% a lot on  their plate. But for a people that are using this every day ... 
% to sort  of put back a little bit into ... you know ... ok so you do ... 
% you ...  you use imposition every day. So ... just do a little tutorial on 
%  imposition. Just like ... sort of giving this sense that maybe ... It's  
% free software ... you know ... We all complain about the documentation so  
% ... these people really know how to do  a lot of things. But maybe that's  
% not even the right angle. Maybe the right angle is for people who are  
% stumbling around to write more of their experience and then give  feedback 
% from the power users. Sort of this like process. But one thing  that I

% about is ... for the ... we were talking about ways to make like   ... to 
% distinguish as a member what do you get extra. Because right now  sort of 
% ... NTG's approach is that all articles published in MAPS, the  pdfs only 
% come online a year after they've been written. Which to me ...  I'm not

Ballistics comes from artillery.
So you shot at a thing. If you hit it, you hit it. 
If you miss it, you change the amount of gun powder, the angle.
So code is very much a ballistic practise.
I think that filters into  this difference in how the conversation works.
And this goes back to the agencies where you have to wait for the 
computer to  figure out. To come with its into the conversation. 
You're putting the code in and then the computer is like
`ok; this is what the code means` 
and then
`is this what you wanted?`
Whereas  with the  WYSIWYG kind of  interface the agency is distributed in a 
different way.  The computer is  just like
`ok, I'm a canvas; I'm just here to hold what  you're putting on` 
and
`I'm not going to change it any way or  affect it in any way that you don't tell me to`.
I mean it's the same way but I ...
is it just  a matter of the compilation time?
In one you're sort of running a experiment,  in  another you're just sort of painting.
If  that's a real enough distinction or if that's ... you know ... it's sort  of ...

Dismissing the other tools is ... I was kinda joking, but ...  
there is something sort of blocklike: Point. Move. This.
But at the same time, like I said, like I wouldn't do a cover in ConTeXt.
Just like I probably  wouldn't try to do something like a recreation of a 
Pre-Raphaelite painting in rocessing or something like that. 
There is just points where our metaphors break down.
And so ... It sounded sort of, like I am like 
**_ok, bottom-up über alles_**  like **always**.

Wether we like  it or not. So how can you not dismiss, not make that split
so hard by saying _this is about not wanting  to see the computer_.
This is about being in dialog with the computer.
Without pushing the commandline as the only way to go.
Or flexibility  is always about standardisation or modularisation.
Well, there  is another kind of flexibility that I don't  think is much ...
