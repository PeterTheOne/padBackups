    * There will be at least a big workshop tent, and maybe a smaller tent for some quiet/relaxing.
    * There will be a banner on the workshop tent, so people recognize us

    * Some people will be arriving on the 11th (Day -1) and start putting up our village. You are welcome to join :) 
    * Register a telephone number at Eventphone ([[https://www.eventphone.de]] ) and bring your home telephone or an old mobile phone for keeping in touch! (see [[https://events.ccc.de/camp/2015/wiki/Static:POC]] and [[https://events.ccc.de/camp/2015/wiki/Static:GSM]] )
  * Social media
    * Some of us are announcing the village on Twitter, also under the #CCCamp15 hashtag - we want to be visible
    * If people come to our village and ask annoying or basic questions, we either refer them to a "queersplainer" if available, or we say "Sorry, come back later" - we could prepare a flyer to explain the basics, and why we don't feel like explaining the basics all the time

  * **We would like to do another meetup.**
